## YOLOv4 - Computer Vision<br/>

This project is to use pretained yolo tiny weights and finetune them so as to detect a single object "person" out of many objects in a video or a photograph.<br/>

It aims at identifying <ins>ONLY</ins> persons in a photograph or a video.<br/>

For my customized model, I used YOLOv4 Darknet framework with VOC2007 data.<br/>


### Learnings<br/>
1. YOLOv4 weights finetuning<br/>
2. Custom Object detection<br/>
3. Tuning CNN Model as per requirement<br/>
