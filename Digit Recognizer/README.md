## Digits classification for MNIST dataset - Computer Vision Fundamentals<br/>

This project is a Kaggle project ( https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer ).<br/>

It aims at classifying digits(0-9) in MNIST dataset.<br/>

With the proposed network I achieved an accuracy of 99.332% on test datset.  I was later able to tune this network and get to an accuracy level of 99.414% on test dataset.<br/>
