## YOLOv5 - Computer Vision - Mask Detection<br/>

This project is to use pretained YOLOv5s weights and finetune them so as to detect a single object "person". Furthermore, We finetune the weights so as to classify "person wearing masks" and "person not wearing masks" out of many objects in a video or a photograph.<br/>

It aims at classifying persons <ins>WITH</ins> masks and persons <ins>WITHOUT</ins> masks in a photograph or a video.<br/>

For my customized model, I used YOLOv5 Darknet framework with Custom dataset.<br/>

### Learnings<br/>
1. Collection of Raw dataset images<br/>
2. Image Annotation<br/>
3. Image Labelling<br/>
4. YOLOv5 weights custom training<br/>
5. Custom Object detection<br/>
6. Tuning CNN Model as per requirement<br/>
