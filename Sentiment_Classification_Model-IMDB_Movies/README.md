## Sentiment Classification Model for IMDB movie reviews<br/>

This project is to classify reviews of IMDB movies as posative or negative reviews using Text classification methodologies such as Word2Vec & LSTM.

### Learnings<br/>
1. Binary text classification<br/>
2. Text data preprocessing for Neural Networks in Keras.<br/>
3. Build & Train an LSTM model for Text Classification using Keras.<br/>
4. Train a Word2Vec Model using Gensim architecture.<br/>
5. Transfer Learning for Text data.<br/>
